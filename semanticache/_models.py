    The provider host is always part of the scope, so a cached response is

    - :attr:`MODEL` (default) — each ``(host, model)`` pair gets its own vector
      set, so a ``gpt-4o`` answer is never served to a ``gpt-4o-mini`` call.
    - :attr:`HOST` — every model or deployment on the same provider shares one
      vector set. Safe only for format-compatible pools (e.g. several Azure
      OpenAI deployments, or treating ``gpt-4o`` and ``gpt-4o-mini`` as
      interchangeable).

    Members are also plain strings, so ``"model"`` / ``"host"`` are accepted
    anywhere a :class:`CacheScope` is expected.
