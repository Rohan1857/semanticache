"""Show that the cache key includes the system prompt, not just user turns.

Khazad embeds the full conversation -> system + all role:text lines, so a
different system prompt with the same user question is a different cache entry.
Calls 1 and 2 share the "concise" system prompt: MISS then HIT. Call 3 swaps in
a different system prompt, which embeds sufficiently far away to drop below the
threshold and is a MISS, so identical user text under different instructions
never cross-serves.

Run from the repo root:
> uv run --group examples python -P examples/anthropic_system.py
-P (safe path) stops the cwd from shadowing the installed `khazad` package.
